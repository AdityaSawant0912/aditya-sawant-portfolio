                                This research paper, conducted under the guidance of Dr. Manimala Mahato from SAKEC and Prof. Biplab Banerjee from IIT Bombay, proposes the S3A-Net, a novel Spatial-Spectral Self-Attention Network, for few-shot learning-based hyperspectral image classification. The S3A-Net leverages self-attention mechanisms to effectively capture spatial and spectral features, enhancing the discriminative capabilities of the classification model. By integrating few-shot learning techniques, the proposed framework enables accurate classification even with limited labeled training samples, addressing the challenges posed by the scarcity of labeled hyperspectral data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the S3A-Net over existing methods in terms of classification accuracy and robustness, highlighting its potential for various remote sensing applications.

                                My team and I collaborated to develop a website for the Indian Development Foundation (IDF), aimed at managing Balgurukul (small school) operations, including teacher, student, and management interactions. We implemented role-based logins for teachers, students, and administrators to streamline access. The primary challenge we addressed was the grading process, which previously relied on manual input through Google Forms, leading to redundant data entry and inefficiencies. To mitigate this issue, we designed an intuitive user interface that simplified the grading process significantly, alleviating the burden on teachers and enhancing overall efficiency. By automating and optimizing the grading workflow, we improved the educational experience for both teachers and students while enhancing the operational effectiveness of IDF&apos;s Balgurukul program.
